# Spring Boot based Java web application

This is a simple **Spring Boot** based Java application that can be built using **Maven**.  
Spring Boot dependencies are handled using the `pom.xml` at the root directory of the repository.

This is an **MVC architecture-based application**, where the controller returns a page with **title** and **message** attributes to the view.
